Here's the recommended design:
https://www.figma.com/file/JnKjp1HPq9LtyQpIbYxrmg/Tax.io---Taxi-ui-kit-(Community)?node-id=1%3A23

So create UI screens:
1. Login with Facebook
2. Dashboard screen that will have a search bar (for Pickup address), a Map (https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/map-view/)
   - On clicking upon the search bar, a modal should appear that will have a search bar and random addresses below (we'll make it dynamic in next classes)
   - Upon clicking any address, should save in the state. The modal should close and the address should appear against the search bar on dashboard and a continue button.
