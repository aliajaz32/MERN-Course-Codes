1. Create multiple screens (Dashboard, Profile, Detail etc), render them in App.js along with the list above. On clicking each item, it should render that component only.
2. Develop a Facebook post component!That will take a prop as an object
{
createdBy: 'Somebody's name'
avatar: 'Somebody profile picture url'
description: "I'm not feeling good today!",
images: ['something.com/abc.jpg', ''something.com/xyz.jpg'']
createdAt: Date.now(),
}
develop the component to use these fields with the same design as Facebook posts or think for another unique and stunning design.

If the images are provided in the object, it should show images as in FB.
* Use https://github.com/Expertizo/react-fb-image-grid for facebook grid images... (follow the README for instructions)

What else left after the above things, we'll implement in future assignments!
This will enable you to provide your components to other developers, they'll just need to add an object and magically your component will return a Facebook post feature!
Basically, I'm moving you guys to develop a library!
